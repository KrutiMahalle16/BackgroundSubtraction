# BackgroundSubtraction
# Background Subtraction for Motion Detection

This project implements **background subtraction** to detect moving objects in a video using Python and OpenCV. Background subtraction is a common technique in video surveillance and computer vision for detecting moving objects by separating the background from the foreground.

## üß† What is Background Subtraction?

Background subtraction is a method of segmenting out foreground objects from the background in a sequence of video frames. It helps in identifying motion or changes in scenes by detecting pixels that differ significantly from a background model.
